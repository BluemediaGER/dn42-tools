# dn42-tools

This repository contains some of the tools I use to run my DN42 network, bluemedia.dn42. I will publish all kinds of scripts and configurations I use in my network within this repo. Maybe there is something you want to use for your own network.  
If you want to find out more about my network itself, check out [dn42.bluemedia.dev](https://dn42.bluemedia.dev) or [bluemedia.dn42](http://bluemedia.dn42), if you are connected to DN42.
